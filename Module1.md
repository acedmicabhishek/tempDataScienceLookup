### 5. Exploratory Data Analytics
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods. It is a critical step in the data analysis process that helps to:
-   Understand the structure of the data
-   Identify outliers and anomalies
-   Test hypotheses and assumptions
-   Discover patterns and relationships between variables

### 6. Quantitative Technique and Graphical Technique
**Quantitative Techniques:** These techniques involve analyzing data using mathematical and statistical methods. Some common quantitative techniques include:
-   **Descriptive Statistics:** Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
-   **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
-   **Correlation Analysis:** To measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
-   **Regression Analysis:** To model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

**Graphical Techniques:** These techniques involve using plots and charts to visualize data and uncover insights. Some common graphical techniques include:
-   **Histograms:** To visualize the distribution of a single variable.
-   **Scatter plots:** To visualize the relationship between two variables.
-   **Box plots:** To visualize the distribution of a variable and identify outliers.
-   **Heatmaps:** To visualize the correlation between multiple variables.
-   **Bar charts:** To compare the values of different categories.
